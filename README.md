# About the environment

This task was introduced in [Dietterich2000] to illustrate some issues in hierarchical reinforcement learning. There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another. You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff, and lose 1 point for every timestep it takes. There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.

2) numpy : pip install numpy
3) collections : pip install collections
4) Matplotlib : pip install matplotlib
5) Random : pip install random

# Running the code
1) Clone the repo into a folder
2) open the main.py file and run it. You can also choose to do it via a terminal

# Special Information
1) The env.py file is a sample test of the environemnt using a random poilcy this is just a visualization of the environrment.

You can also use this as a starter code for training agents on more discrete environments.
